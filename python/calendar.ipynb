The WSC begins its four quarter sequence (quarter A) at the Southern Solstice, December 21. (By starting at the Equinox, the Tempordesic Calendar is retaining a hemispheric neutrality.) In addition the WSC numbers days in a quarter 1-91 whereas the Tempordesic Calendar cycles seven day periods over 13 weeks and incorporates the week reference into the notation. For more information about the World Season Calendar a couple of related links below:\n",
